                <p>For your own safety and the safety of the bees, we have some requirements for your roof. <br><br>Our beekeepers will regularly check on your bees to make sure they are healthy. Therefore, your roof needs to be easily accessible for them. Your roof of course needs to be flat it also needs to be stable and strong enough, to make sure that it will be safe for both you and your bees. And be sure that there is space on your roof for our beekeepers to work. <br><br> Your bees will need clean water, so be sure that this will be possible to get to your roof. We suggest having some plant that your bees can pollinate on the roof.

If you think your bees may affect your neighbors, be sure that knows about it and is fine with it.</p>

                <p><a class="linkInText" href="https://www.facebook.com/Honningcentralen/posts/1220051304815610/"> Even thou many insects die during the winter, honeybees survive, and they don’t even hibernate.</a> All the workers cling together with their queen in the middle to stay warm. The bees are rotating on staying on the outside, just like the penguins! For the outer bees it can get quite cold and they nearly cannot move, but for the queen and the other inner bees the temperature stays up till 35 °C. <br><br>Our beehives are well isolated for winter to make it easier for the bees. And our beekeepers will keep an extra eye on your bees and to look after them. We will check on your bees every two weeks, to take the temperature and feed them to keep them strong.</p>
