                <p><a class="linkInText" href="https://www.facebook.com/Honningcentralen/posts/1220051304815610/"> Even though many insects die during the winter, honeybees survive, and they don’t even hibernate.</a> All the workers cling together with their queen in the middle to stay warm. The bees are rotating on staying on the outside, just like the penguins! For the outer bees it can get quite cold and they nearly cannot move, but for the queen and the other inner bees the temperature stays up till 35 °C. <br><br>Our beehives are well isolated for winter to make it easier for the bees. And our beekeepers will keep an extra eye on your bees and to look after them. We will check on your bees every two weeks, to take the temperature and feed them to keep them strong.</p>
